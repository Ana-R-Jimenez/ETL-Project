# ETL-Project

* Two CSV files were used to create the Datasets. One CSV file was downloaded from the California Energy Commison. This file included the Electricity Consumption by County. The second file was downloaded from U.S Census Bureau this provided the Population from each County.

* The CSV files were cleaned to create new Dataframes that would only include the County, Population, and Total Usage.Created connection and used Pandas to load CSV converted DataFrame into Database.



* Potential analysis on the dataset created could be inquiries such as:

    *   What county has the highest Electricty Usage?
    *   What is the average Electricity Usage by County?
    *   Does Electricity Usage or Pouplation have a higher growing rate?
